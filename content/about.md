Axolotl loves mathematics and physics. Axolotl has been studying General Relativity and realized that her knowledge in mathematics was not solid enough. So now she is studying stuff about diffenrential geometry. The book she is now using is [*Calculus on Manifolds*](http://www.amazon.com/Calculus-On-Manifolds-Approach-Classical/dp/0805390219) by Michael Spivak.
