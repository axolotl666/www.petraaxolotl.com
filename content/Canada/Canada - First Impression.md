(The text below is from my personal journal and reflected my experience at the time of writing.)

# Day 1 - Saturday, 15 July 2017

I was picked up by the CEO. A nice surprise. He drove me to the hotel and we had sushi for dinner
afterwards. During the dinner, he shared with me his life story. How he moved from one country to
another and then finally to Canada; how he survived with only 700 CAD in his pocket, etc. He
behaved more like a friend rather than a boss. It was a very positive experience.

# Day 2 - Sunday, 16 July 2017

I spent my second day (a Sunday) walking around the area where I plan to find an apartment/house.
I saw an old lady disposing of her rubbish and asked whether I could ask her a few questions. I
explained to her that I was considering renting an apartment there. She was extremely friendly and
even invited me in her apartment to take a look. She said "Sorry it's so messy. I did not expect
you would come. I am so sorry." When I told her that it's my second day in Canada and I had already
applied for PR, she seemed so happy and said "If you decide to live here, please knock at my door.
It is not always easy to move to a new country. I want to be your friend." I hope she is
representative of how nice Canadians are! She also mentioned she never bothered to lock her door.

I was very impressed by the fact that there were more rainbow flags in the city than the national
flags. I even saw a rainbow crossing instead of the traditional zebra crossing.

I was also happy to find out that it takes only a 10-minute walk from my office (in Midtown
Toronto) to get on a hiking trail, where I was surrounded by trees and saw very few people. The
weather was great and the temperature was around 26 degrees Celsius. I walked 16 kilometers and yet
was less tired than when I had walked two kilometers in Singapore

# Day 3 - Monday, 17 July 2017

After a great Sunday, came a not so great Monday.

I planned to do the following.

- Get a SIN number;
- Open a bank account;
- Get enrolled in the Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP).

Note that 1) has to be done at a Service Centre Canada while 3) has to be done at a ServiceOntario,
because the first is regulated on the federal level while the second on the provincial level. I can
achieve 2) only with a SIN.

Around 8:40am, I was at the ServiceOntario at 839 Yonge St, and after a 30-minute wait, I was told
that they did not handle it for people on a work permit and that I had to go to another
ServiceOntario at 777 Bay St.

Around 9:15am, I arrived at the Service Centre Canada at 25 St Clair Ave E. Again, after a
30-minute wait, I was told that their system was not working and was advised to come back in the
afternoon.

I went back there around 2:30pm, and their computer system was still down and I will have to go
there again tomorrow and see if my luck turns any better.

Finally around 4:10pm, I was at the ServiceOntario at 777 Bay St, with a letter from my employer
as "proof of residence". I waited about 15 minutes and was told that the letter was not good
enough, because it only had my employer's address, not my residential address. The funny thing is
that they suggested that I should first get an ID card, for which I would be able to provide any
random address without any proof, and then use that as the "proof of address" for the OHIP. So
essentially they were teaching me how to circumvent their stupid rules. But alas, it would take
at least a few days for me to receive the ID card so it is much easier for me to ask for a new
letter from my employer.

The only thing positive was that I used the opportunity at Service Centre Canada to practice my
French for free, as all government employees are required to speak both English and French.

# Day 4 - Tuesday, 18 July 2017

Tuesday. Finally managed to do the following.

- Registered for OHIP. 20 minutes in total. Helped by a very friendly lady. A new immigrant (or
temporary worker) will become eligible only three months after landing. So I need to figure out a
way to get myself covered for the next 89 days.
- Got the SIN number. 60 minutes in total. Helped by another very friendly lady.
- Opened a bank account and applied for a credit card at CIBC. More than 60 minutes due to their
IT issues. Helped by a third very friendly lady. As I am a new temporary worker, both the bank
account and the credit card are free for the first year. Also, assuming that I will have already
become a PR by July 2018, I can get another year for free. So in total I will have two years of
free full-service banking. (After that I plan to switch to an online free bank such as Tangerine.)
The credit card will arrive in a week. This is super important to build up my credit history.
Buying houses and renting them out can be very profitable (much more than the 8% long-term stock
market return) if one can avoid the 15% foreign buyer tax (by becoming a PR) and get reasonable
mortgage rates. Hopefully I can start buying houses in January 2018.
- Found an affordable low-rise apartment (1,700 CAD including heating and water) in an affluent
neighbourhood with a lot of green (Leaside). Only 35 minutes away (on foot) from work. It will
become available on 1 September so I will unfortunately have to stay at some AirBnb for more than
a month.

Clearly I am extremely calculative on financial matters. Many commercial institutions would go out
of business if all their customers were like me.

# Day 7 - Friday, 21 July 2017

Remember the super nice lady whom I met on Sunday? I went there because I had seen an
advertisement for an apartment there. I had called the agent before I went there and had already
learned that there was one person who had already submitted his/her lease application. I was hoping
his/her application would be rejected. Unfortunately for me (but fortunately for him/her), I
learned on Tuesday his/her rent application was approved.

It was a disappointment. But the flip side was that I found a bigger apartment in the same area for
less money. (1,700 CAD for a 2-bedroom instead of 1,800 CAD for a 1-bedroom). I managed to submit
my application on Wednesday and will hear back next Monday.

Regarding my lease application, there were several points worth noting.

- I had to provide "proof of income". It could be a problem for those who move to Canada without a
job.
- I was asked to pay the first and the last months' rent by either check or money order. (They
would not accept cash.) But a checkbook at ICBC costs more than 60 CAD and a money order costs 7.50
CAD. I eventually managed to get two money orders for free but in retrospect, I should have
negotiated for a free checkbook before I opened an account.
- Since I did not want to convert my USD to CAD and pay FX fees, I asked my employer for an advance
on my salary. This saved me at least 34 CAD. (Even the cheapest option, Transferwise, charges
about 1%. Interactive Brokers is technically much cheaper but it would take at least two weeks.)

I use my US credit card (Chase Sapphire which has zero FX fees) for my daily expenses in Canada.
This saves me quite a bit of money. Also, my employer has agreed to cover any medical costs for
the next three months before the OHIP kicks in. It is important to ask for more and negotiate.

A funny thing is that for the first time in my life, I met someone who thinks in exactly the same
way as I do on financial matters. This colleague of mine has bought five or six units outside
Toronto where rental yields are much higher. With 70% of the property value financed by mortgages,
he manages to get a return on equity greater than 40%. Yet, he rents a basement apartment for
himself for only 1,000 CAD a month. It was a such a pleasure talking with him about personal
finance as we could immediately understand each other's reasoning process. He showed me his
spreadsheet for his property investments and I showed him my ETF portfolio.

My medical was passed yesterday and nowadays IRCC seems to be really fast. It seems not unlikely
for me to be able to start buying houses in September without having to pay the 15% tax for
foreigners, instead of next January as previously envisaged.

Tomorrow finally some time to visit Downtown Toronto!

# Day 8 - Saturday, 22 July 2017

Eventually I did not visit Downtown Toronto on Saturday. On Friday night, I got a text message
from the Jewish colleague who does real estate side business, inviting me to hike with him at
Hilton Falls on Saturday. (Let's call him L from now on. It is also interesting that half of the
tech team, i.e. data scientists + software engineers + product manager, are Jewish at the
company.) The nature was beautiful. He brought some tenderloin for barbecue and I found some wild
oyster mushrooms on a dead tree. Including the walk from my hotel to the meeting point where he
picked me up by car, I walked almost 22 kilometers. After that we had dinner together at a nice
Lebanese restaurant. Despite my protest, he insisted on paying for everything, from gasoline,
to park entrance fees, to the dinner.

# Day 9 - Sunday, 23 July 2017

To save hotel/Airbnb costs, I slept on a couch at the company on Saturday and Sunday. To reward
myself for the cost saving, I had lunch on Sunday at Korean Grill House, where their All Day
All-You-Can-Eat barbecue menu costs only 20.99 CAD (excluding tax). Obviously, I was the first
employee who "arrived" at work on Monday morning. This amazed another colleague who's usually the
first in the office every morning.

# Days 10 to 12 - Monday, 24 July 2017 to Wednesday 26 July 2017

I moved to my Airbnb place (for a week from 24 July to 31 July) on Monday evening. Somehow I hurt
my back when taking a shower and walking became rather painful. On Tuesday, we had a company
offsite that included treetop trekking. I hesitated whether I should go and called the CEO, who
sent an Uber to pick me up. Overall, it was a great day with fun activities.

My colleagues were super nice when they knew about my back injury. They gave me not only medical
advice, but also patches for muscle pain.

Today when talking about relocation-related stuff, the CEO mentioned that I could sleep in the
office during the weekend, without knowing that I had already done it :) My colleague L offered me
to sleep on his futon for free, until I move in my apartment on 1 September. I think I will take
advantage of one or both offers.

The apartment application process turned out to be a huge hassle. I provided all the required
documents last Wednesday, only to hear on Monday that the manager (who's a different person than
the super intendant of the apartment complex) wanted also my US credit scores and my bank
statements. I sent her my credit reports with excellent credit scores, without bank statements
because the super intendant said the latter would not be necessary. But then on Tuesday, the
manager insisted on having my bank statements, despite my credit reports listing all my US credit
cards with a combined credit limit of more than 50,000 USD and a current debt of zero. After some
arguments I made concession and sent my US bank statements and heard today (Wednesday) that my
application had been approved. The manager is in my opinion an idiot but fortunately the super
intendant has promised that I will not have to deal with the manager ever again after the
application was approved.

For publicity (potentially useful for future HR efforts), my employer arranged an interview
with a Wall Street Journal journalist for me and another colleague who moved to Toronto from Israel
on 17 July. The journalist wanted stories about "tech talents who have chosen Canada over the US
since Trump was elected President". We had the interview today and I am curious whether I will
soon read about myself on the WSJ.
